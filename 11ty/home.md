Welcome to Byte Fiction, a place where I write about my creations. 
Say, Programming language interpreters, video games, template engines, parsers, transpilers or anything else that
I find interesting in the moment. You probably already noticed a common theme with Programming language 
design in that list, which happens to be my primary interest. 

This blog is also meant to serve as a way to document my projects in a way that isn't totally boring to read.
If you find some of these interesting, stick around. :)
